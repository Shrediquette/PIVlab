% PIVLAB_CITING MATLAB code for PIVlab_citing.fig
%      PIVLAB_CITING, by itself, creates a new PIVLAB_CITING or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = PIVLAB_CITING returns the handle to a new PIVLAB_CITING or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      PIVLAB_CITING('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in PIVLAB_CITING.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      PIVLAB_CITING('Property','Value',...) creates a new PIVLAB_CITING or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before PIVlab_citing_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to PIVlab_citing_OpeningFcn via varargin.

Leading-edge vortices develop at high effective angles of attack and enhance the circulation and hence the aerodynamic force. The intensity of leading-edge vortices can be greatly influenced by the airfoil design, such as camber and thickness. It is likely that birds and bats benefit from these possibilities to control LEVs. The aerodynamic efficiency however decreases with the development of LEVs. The efficiency can be modulated and improved by twisting the wings. That does however decrease the magnitude of the aerodynamic force coefficients and can most likely not be afforded in all flight modes: At higher flight speeds, force coefficients do not need to be maximal, and wing twist increases both the L/D and the span efficiency. Low flight speeds require maximal force coefficients and efficiency becomes of secondary interest. \n Such a competition between efficiency and peak forces also exists in technical flight: Fixed wing aircraft are very efficient in cruising flight, but -- unlike birds -- do not generate enough lift in slow speed flight. Rotary wing devices can generate sufficient forces in slow and hovering flight, but -- again unlike birds -- have an inferior efficiency at higher flight speeds. Flapping wing micro air vehicles can combine the advantages of rotary and fixed wing aircraft. A prototype and a method that may predict the aerodynamic forces generated in slow-speed flapping flight using a theory of delta-wing aircraft was developed. The MAV is equipped with bird-inspired wings that perform very well in both gliding flight and slow-speed flapping flight. \n The combination of flight modes enables to develop micro air vehicles that might one day have a similar performance as birds: Exceptional manoeuvrability in combination with an outstanding aerodynamic efficiency.}\n}');fclose(fid);
