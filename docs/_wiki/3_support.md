# Support

You can get support in the [Google Groups forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en-GB#!forum/pivlab). Usually I am very responsive. If you have problems analyzing your data, please always provide the original data in the forum. And if I have a fix or a solution for your problem, please give me feedback if it worked!
